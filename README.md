✈️ My Airlines Reservation System
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my personal project – a Flight Reservation System! I put this together to dig deeper into some C programming concepts, particularly with handling data structures. It’s all about booking, canceling, and managing airline seats in a way that’s easy to follow.

🌟 Features
Flight Info: Displays all available flights, including departure and arrival times, price, and routes.
Seat Booking: You can book a seat by picking the flight you want and selecting the seats you prefer. I even added a feature that shows “X” for booked seats so you can avoid them.
Cancellation Option: Need to cancel a seat? You can select the seat, and the system will ask for confirmation before canceling.
Reservation Details: Check all booked seats with info like passenger name, age, and gender.
Data Import: The flight details get loaded from a Flight-details file.
🛠 How it Works
Data Structures: I used linked lists to manage flights and seats.
File Handling: This project reads flight data from a Flight-details file but doesn’t yet write back to it.
Simple CLI: The system runs in the terminal with a basic menu to help you navigate between booking, canceling, viewing reservations, and more.
📝 Improvements to Come
This project has a lot of room for improvement, and I’m well aware of it! Here are some updates I have in mind:

File Writing: Currently, it only reads flight details from Flight-details and doesn’t save any new bookings or cancellations. Adding this would make the system a lot more useful.
Error Handling and Validation: It could use better prompts and error checking to make it smoother to use.
User Interface: Since it’s a basic CLI app, there’s potential for making it friendlier and maybe adding some more helpful prompts.
💡 Why This Project?
This was my hands-on way to learn C programming basics, especially around data management. If you’re checking it out, feel free to suggest improvements or play around with the code!

📢 Thanks!
If you’ve taken the time to check this out, thanks a ton! This project is part of my journey to get more comfortable with C programming, and I’m glad to share it.
